# AroundPercolationProblem
Here are some programs I used to simulate percolation model with few liquids possible. 

There is three pars of this project.

Firstly, there are some programs, written, using Python. They are not very efficient and describy only the case of three liquids. But they are easier to understed and verify.

Secondly, there is a program written, using C++. It is more efficient. It simulate the case of any number of liquids also.

Thirdly, there are some programs, I used to drow graphs. They are on Python too and use matplotlib.pyplot
